    The class openstack_extras::repo::debian::debian has now a new parameter
    use_extrepo, which is true by default. If true, extrepo will be used for
    setting-up the OpenStack apt sources.list, and the parameters source_hash,
    source_defaults and deb_location are ignored. Beware that this is now
    the new default!
