    The yumrepo resources for RDO and CentOS Advanced Virt in the
    openstack_extras::repo::redhat::redhat class now sets the new
    parameter module_hotfixes included since 6.15.0 if the Puppet
    version is supporting that. If you for some reason is using
    standalone Puppet that does not include vendored modules (i.e
    you are not using Puppet packages) you will need to make sure
    that yumrepo_core >= 1.0.7 is used.
